## Deprecation notice

 STMicroelectronics released their header definitions under more permissive licensing terms. Now [this](https://github.com/the-cave/stm8s-header "STM8S header") is possible.  
   
 If you are OK with their license, the migration to official header definitions is recommended. Otherwise, check the [master branch](https://github.com/midnight-wonderer/stm8-header/tree/master) of this repository. I do not expect the branch to be updated but it will still be around and usable.

## Recommendation

If you prefer least intrusive patches to the official headers for [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ "Small Device C Compiler") support, I recommend my own flavor of the header.
